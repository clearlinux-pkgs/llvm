Subject: [cfe] Allow building split libclang libraries with unified LLVM lib

We use LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB to build the llvm libraries as shared, but that
does not work for clang. We can use BUILD_SHARED_LIBS on clang, but since we
build them all together, we need to smuggle it in using this patch.
