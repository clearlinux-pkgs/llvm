Subject: [PATCH] Produce a normally-versioned libLLVM

This patch is originally from
https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/openSUSE:Factory/llvm7/llvm-normally-versioned-libllvm.patch?expand=1

  Before llvm4, both major and minor version updates of llvm were regularly
  breaking API. Because of that, the libLLVM library was named in following
  format: libLLVM-${major}-${minor}.so

    (https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25059)
    (https://reviews.llvm.org/D13841)

  The package containing this library was called libLLVM${major}_${minor} which
  follows our guidelines.

  Since llvm4, llvm decided to follow semantic versioning and only break API if
  the major version was increased. In addition they do not intend to ever have
  minor version other than 0.
    (http://blog.llvm.org/2016/12/llvms-new-versioning-scheme.html)

  The package was renamed to libLLVM${major}, which no longer follows the naming
  guidelines, but since the package contained multiple libraries, it was not
  detected.

  Since bnc#1049703 the libLLVM${major} package contains only the
  libLLVM-${major}-${minor}.so library and no others. This triggers the
  shlib-policy-name-error check in our packaging system.

  Because the reasons for using the libLLVM-${major}-${minor}.so format are no
  longer valid, lets revert back to libLLVM.so.${major}.${minor}.${version}
  format. That way the package name matches our guidelines.
